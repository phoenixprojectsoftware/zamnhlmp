Release Notes:
==============

Well, creating this application was easier than I thought... It works for
all the sprites I checked in Valve's PAK file.

DirectX 3.0 is required.

Version History:
================

V1.05:
======
- Now when you "Save Sequence", the program asks you if you want to create
  a ".qc" file as well. The file created may not always be 100% compatible
  with certain sprites in that the result might not match the original,
  but it is compatible with Valve's "sprgen" utility.

V1.04:
======
- For "Play Once", instead of using the period, I made it "Ctrl-Space".
  The period in the menu was apparently too hard to see, and some people
  complained that it didn't have a hotkey.
- Menus are corrected
- The "Sprite Information" dialog now includes the transparency mode of
  the sprite.

V1.03:
======
Added...
- An "Open" dialog.
- A "Save BMP" option, which saves the current frame.
- A "Save Sequence" option, which saves all the frames in the sprites,
  adding on three digits to the end of the filename.
- A "Sprite Information" dialog, just shows you the size (in pixels)
  and total number of frames.

Changes...
- The "Speed" dialog is now "Ctrl-P"; the "Save BMP" option is now 
  "Ctrl-S". Figured the program wasn't out for long enough to 
  aggravate anyone because of this change
- Fixed crashes with certain sprites in the Half-Life PAK file

V1.02:
======
- Apparently, at least as it appears on my 3Dfx adapter, all graphic
  depths are fixed. 24-bit looks sweet. Couldn't test 32-bit at home
  because I don't have that option.
- Variable size sprites ("320_pain.spr", for instance) are now supported.
- Now instead of animation speed in milliseconds, I'm using "frames per
  second" (recommended by "Autolycus" from the "Half-Life Editing Resource
  Center" at "http://halflife.gamedesign.net/"... thanks!)

V1.01:
======
- Supports 16-bit and 32-bit flawlessly, 24-bit has been theoretically
  implemented but not tested. 8-bit is extremely screwy and may not
  draw properly. Who uses 8-bit these days anyway? 

V1.0:
=====
- It's a very early Beta, and works only in 8-bit (not very well) and 
  16-bit color space. My office development machine doesn't support 24-bit
  space (jumps straight to 32), so I'll have to test that some other time.
- Doesn't support what are seemingly referred to as "SPR_GROUP" frame
  types. Documentation is sketchy on these things...
- You can't open files from within the program; expect a future one to.

Usage:
======

Double click on a sprite and tell it to use this program. This program
could be in any directory.

Once in the program:
<Space>:		Stops playback and cycles through the animation frame by 
				frame
Ctrl-<Space>:	Play sprite once, then stop
<Enter>:		Resume normal playback
Ctrl-P:			Set the delay (in milliseconds) between each frame
+ / -:			Zoom in / out

Ctrl-O:			Open a sprite
Ctrl-S:			Save current frame as a bitmap
Ctrl-Shift-S:	Save numerical sequence of bitmaps
Ctrl-I:			Sprite Information dialog
