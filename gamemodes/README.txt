Here are the gamemode configuration files.
Please don't change any of this, it will confuse your players if you do.
Feel free to add your own gamemode - just copy paste from one of the existing ones.
The first line specifies the gamemode name that should be displayed in the server browser and in the splash with server settings data in-game.
The second line is help text displayed when someone types 'help' in console.
