Half-Life Sprite Wizard v1.1
=============================
A Half-Life sprite compiler with a Windows interface. It takes
you through a few easy steps to put together a sprite from a
series of .bmp files that you've made.

For more information about sprites, check these tutorials:

Remember that Additive and Alphatest are what you'll most likely
use for sprites. Additive is 256 colors, it doesn't have any special
requirements for it's palette and is a standard picture on a dark
background. Alphatest is like a .gif, with 255 colors for the picture,
and the last color in the palette is for transparency.

The Viewing Options defaults to show Alphatest sprites' transparency
color as black, giving the impression of being transparent. Uncheck
it if you want to see the actual transparent color.

This program has been tested in Win95, Win98 and NT4, and will
bring up message boxes for all known errors. It supports Color
Modes over 256 colors, and Small and Large Font Settings. If you
come across a bug, send in a detailed description to me.

Version 1.1 fixes the banding distortion for color sprites with 
less than 256 colors. Thanks to MrPastry and ShockMan from 
Wavelength's Forums for letting me know about this bug.

Thanks to the regulars in the #HLediting channel on, the now deceased, 
irc.3dnet.net for testing, most notably Malengine, EL (Mike Ottaway), 
Ease and Bringer.

Thanks to Ken "Page Fault" Alverson and Trevor Lanz 
for answering my C++ questions.
