These files define entity placements for the CTF gamemode,
effectively making any map you want supported for Capture the Flag.

For the Red Team spawn point, use the entity 'info_player_team2'. For the
Red Flag, use the entity 'item_flag_team2'.

For the Blue Team spawn point, use the entity 'info_player_team1'. For the
Blue Flag, use the entity 'item_flag_team1'.

You can get your coordinates in-game by typing 'status' in the console.

Example:
The entity.       Coordinates.    Rotation.
