# ZAMNHLMP 2.6 - The Start of Something New!
Starting with 2.6 we are introducing seasonal content, starting with Season 6. Each season of ZAMNHLMP brings in new maps,
models, sounds and more! And there's no additional patches to make!

We will continue our season scheme until we reach Season 10; where
the game will then be re-evaluated to see if we can continue adding new content
constantly, or if we will only preserve the game with bug fix updates; so
if the last version were to be 2.10, if we were to continue with the seasonal
scheme we would update up to 2.11 for Season 11, 2.12 for Season 12 and so forth,
and if we had decided to stop the seasonal scheme, we would update to 3.0 and only
release bug fix updates from that point on (3.0.1, 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, etc).
