Description             : Converted Model for Half-Life DM

All Credit Due          : to Gabor for creating this great Model
=============================================================================

This is converted Counter Strike Model (one of a complete set).

Basically I updated the animations, but I had to edit some of the mesh to
eliminate some really really weird arm and shoulderblade distortion thingies.

All the compiling and decompiling was done in Milkshape 1.5.10.

The total modification took about 4 hour from start to finish, but there some
time spent over several months of tinkering to try and understand what the
bizarre problem was with the HLDM animations. Some amount of time was spent
checking the animations and mesh ... still a few things I'd like to fix
but oh well!

Info:

new folder called Angesmoke, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.
